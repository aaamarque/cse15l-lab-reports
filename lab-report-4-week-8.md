## Links to the repositories
- This is the [link](https://github.com/aaamarque/markdown-parser) to my markdown-parser repository.

- This is the [link](https://github.com/canitry/markdown-parser) to the repository I reviewed.

## Snippet 1 
- It should produce the following ["`google.com"] because it only recognizes what's on brackets as a link.

## Questions

- For snippet 1, I would have to modify, fix, and change more than 10 lines of code. This is because of the the qouatation marks location and the nested brackets. I would have to put a lot of if statements in order for my code to work properly with the nested brackets. 

- For snippet 2, I would have to modify, fix, and change more than 10 lines of code. This is because of the nested brackets and braces. I would have to put a lot of if statements in order for my code to work properly with the nested brackets and not break my code or give me an infinite loop.

- For snippet 3, I would have to modify, fix, and change more than 10 lines of code. This is because of the spacing within the lines. I would have to put a lot of if statements in order for my code to work properly with the spacing and not break my code or give me an infinite loop because of the spacing. 

**My code does pass any of the tests it fails**
